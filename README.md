Collections of materials for leraning Haskell.

Systematic bird-view on Haskell (mostly just TOC, no explanations):
* **Haskell's toolchain (compile, REPL, etc.)** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_tooling.md
* **Basic language syntax and constructs** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_basesyntax.md
* Typing system:
  * **Monad family** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_monads.md
  * **Monoid family** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_monoids.md
  * **Typing overview** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_typing.md
* **Meta-programming** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_meta.md

Study materials list (focus is more on software design rather than on math theory):
* **Beginner/Intermediate** (focus is mostly on Haskell itself, not on Software Design) — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_study.md
* **Advanced/Architectural** (but minding that Software Design is somewhat language-agnostic) — *TO BE DONE*
