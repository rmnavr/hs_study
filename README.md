Collections of materials for studying Haskell.

Focus here is on 2 things:
* give systematic view on Haskell
* focus on software design and pragmatism, rather than math and abstractions

Haskell bird-view map:
* **Haskell's toolchain (compile, REPL, etc.)** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_tooling.md
* **Basic language syntax and constructs** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_basesyntax.md
* **Monad-related map** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_monads.md
* **Typing map** — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_typing.md

Study materials list:
* **Beginner/Intermediate** (focus is mostly on Haskell itself, not on Software Design) — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/hs_study.md
* **Advanced/Architectural** (but minding that Software Design is somewhat language-agnostic) — TO BE DONE
