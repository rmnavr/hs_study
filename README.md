# Beginner/Intermediate

I poked in:
* `book` **Learn You a Haskell for Greater Good** — considered to be best introductory book for Haskell (despite goofy style)
* `code` **Very basic haskell programs examples** — https://www.haskellforall.com/2015/10/basic-haskell-examples.html
* `youtube` **JSON parser in 100 LOC** (thinking process exposition) — https://github.com/tsoding/haskell-json
* Haskell in Pictures (by Adit) — best material for visualizing monads and such:
  * `article` **Monads intro** — https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html
  * `article` **RWS monads** — https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-06-10-three-useful-monads.html
  * `article` **Lenses** — https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-07-22-lenses-in-pictures.htm
* by William Yaoh:
  * `article` **Haskell study roadmap** — https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-01-11-road-to-proficient.html
  * RWS series (deriving some monads from 1st principles) — good excercises and examples:
    * `article` **State monad** — https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-07-12-deriving-state-monad.html
    * `article` **Reader monad** — https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-07-19-deriving-reader-monad.html
    * `article` **Writer monad** — https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-07-26-deriving-writer-monad.html
  * `article` **Monad transformers 101** — 
* by Kowainik
  * `article` **Basic patterns in Haskell** — https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns
  * `article` **Style guide** — https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide

I heard, but didn't delve:
* `article` **Haskell GoF patterns** — https://github.com/thma/LtuPatternFactory?tab=readme-ov-file#visitor--foldable
