# Main

* [Haskell map (bird-view)](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/materials/hs_map.md)
  — gives you nice picture of how every Haskell-related topic connects to the rest of the language; separates pragmatic parts from esoteric ones
* [Haskell Cheetsheets](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/chsheet/README.md)
* [Haskell code examples](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/demo_code/README.md) — from 30 LOC scripts to demonstrations of industry-level projects
