# Systematic

* [Haskell map (bird-view)](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/materials/hs_map.md) —
  systematic picture of how every Haskell topic connects to the rest of the language (pragmatic and esoteric things are explicitly separated)
* [Haskell roadmap to writing small-to-medium general-purpose apps](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/materials/hs_roadmap.md) —
  clearly outlines what you should learn first, what should be skipped and what are the main checkpoints

# Coding

* [Haskell Cheetsheets](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/chsheets/) — well-organized materials on language usage
* [Haskell apps examples](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/demo_code/README.md) — from 30 LOC demo-scripts to industry-level projects

# Yapping

* [My reasons to learn/use Haskell](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/materials/why_hs.md)
* [Takeaways from yapping articles](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/materials/articles_consp.md)
