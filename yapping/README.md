My (rmnavr) key takeaways on Haskell philosophy and things like that:
* [Yapping](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/chsheet/my_yapping.md)

Why Haskell is good/bad:
* [[→ How does Haskell make life easier]](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-30-how-does-haskell-make-life-easier.html)
  — on Haskell safeness, refactorability and maintainability
* [[→ Haskells niche is hard problems]](https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/haskells-niche-hard-problems/)
  — how Haskell shines at frequent fundamental codebases changes

How to learn Haskell:
* [[→ What I wish somebody told me when I was learning Haskell]](https://www.poberezkin.com/posts/2021-04-21-what-i-wish-somebody-told-me-when-i-was-learning-Haskell.html)
  — change your thinking to type-centric (and Haskell-centric), not function-centric (and imperative)
* [[→ You are already smart enough to learn Haskell]](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html)
  — you can write usefull Haskell programs with just ADTs and IO
* [[→ Advice for Haskell beginners]](https://www.haskellforall.com/2017/10/advice-for-haskell-beginners.html)
  — learn Haskell with right expectations and reasons (it is pleasant language, but will not give you nirvana)
