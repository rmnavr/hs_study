# How I actually learned Haskell

Try 01:
* `book` Basics (syntax, ADTs, typeclasses, monads basics) — LYAH
* `articles` Pictures on monads — adit.io
* `proj` Quantity (10 kg + 5 gm) mini-lib
* `proj` Writing Vim syntax (highlight for Prelude functions)
* `goof` Tried creating project with cabal (also + installing some dependencies)
* `fail` Tried to launch GUI libs in Haskell (on Windows), but failed dramatically
* `side` Understood partial and curry via writing 2 production-level libs in Hy-lang (which is LISP-dialect of Python)

Try 02 (after 2 months):
* `goof` Working with ghc/ghci — ghc docs, ChatGPT
* `book chapter` Better understanding functions composition syntax — Chapter 1 of HDP
* `book chapter` Functor, Applicative, Monad — Chapter 3 of HDP
* `book chapter` Deeper goofing in IO and do syntax — Chapter 2 of HDP
* `proj` Writing this "sorted learning materials" repo, delving into yapping articles
* `book chapter` State monad — Haskell on wikibooks
* `articles` RWS Monads — William Yao
