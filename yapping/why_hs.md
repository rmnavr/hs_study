# What I personally like about Haskell

As a language:
* only ~ x3 times slower than C (Haskell is compiled)
* has REPL
* staticly/strictly typed
* SOA funtional language (+pure, +immuts) 
  > SOA = State-of-the-Art
* SOA typing system (second only to Idris/Agda and such)
* encourages some good practives (IO, separation of concerns)
* nice syntax: ML-like, pointfree possibility, composability (curry by default)

Software design can be learned through Haskell:
* functional architectures SOA (FT, HFM, ...)
* ghc exposes you to Linux/Windows compilation toolchain (and to how OS works)

As a tool:
* overall a pleasant language to use
* great at refactoring, making fundamental changes to codebase, getting back to codebase after 3 years of pause
* compared to other languages: less LOC, but more terse code
* SOA for writing parsers, DSLs, backends, etc.

Other:
* hard but rewarding intellectual challenge

# Be aware of

* Math (Cathegory theory) is not required to learn Haskell
* Haskell can be used both in **enginnering** (pragmatic software design) and in **scientific research**
  (focused on esoteric and possibly impractical things that can lead to dead ends). 
  Be aware of what you are using Haskell for.
* Software design and Architecture is somewhat language agnostic:
  * focus more on patterns and solutions, not just on Haskell
  * you still need to learn languages of other types (system langs, dynamic langs, etc.) to be a good architect
