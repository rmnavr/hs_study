Study materials list (focus is more on software design rather than on math theory):
* [Yappings](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/learn/yapping.md) — philosophical notes on Haskell
* [Beginner/Intermediate](https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/learn/beginner_intermediate.md) (focus is mostly on Haskell itself, not on Software Design) 
* **Advanced/Architectural** (but minding that Software Design is somewhat language-agnostic) — *TO BE DONE*
