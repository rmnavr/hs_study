Study materials list (focus is more on software design rather than on math theory):
* **Beginner/Intermediate** (focus is mostly on Haskell itself, not on Software Design) — https://github.com/rmnavr/hs_study/blob/main/learn/hs_study.md
* **Advanced/Architectural** (but minding that Software Design is somewhat language-agnostic) — *TO BE DONE*
